# Contributing

If you feel like something is missing or incorrect, please send a Pull Request. Before you do though, ensure that 
you've done the following:

* Search for previous Pull Requests before making a new one.
* Please make your Pull Request descriptive.
* Resources should be ordered alphabetically. This helps treat all resources equally. The only exception is if the resources 
should be in a certain order (e.g. the extension development packages).
* New categories are welcomed, but you should have 2 or more tools to submit to that category before submitting a new category.
* Follow the [awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md):
  * End all descriptions with a full stop/period and remove trailing whitespace.
  * Check spelling and grammar.
